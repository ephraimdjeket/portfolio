            <h1> More about me</h1>
            <p class="about-me-p">I’ve always had a deeper desire to create something and solve problems for others. But
                I didn’t know
                exactly how I’d do that. Back in 2022 I started to dabble a bit into graphic design and do some
                freelancing.
                I loved doing it, but it wasn’t quite it. I knew of web development before, but I never truly got into
                it.
                I started to read more about it and to learn. That’s when I fell in love with it and decided to study
                it.

                My main focus as a Front-End Developer is to develop and build functional and beautiful websites and
                apps that will work for you. Whether you’re starting a new business, a personal site or in need of a
                site
                for your products/services, I’ll be here ready to help and work with you. I enjoy working with other
                people
                with the goal of creating something or just assisting with what I can.

                A part from learning and doing web development, I enjoy exercising, traveling, reading and hiking.
