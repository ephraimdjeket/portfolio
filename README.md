This is my first portfolio website, created during the early stages of my studies at Noroff. As part of our coursework, we were tasked with designing and developing a personal portfolio website to showcase the projects we had been working on.

The goal of this project was to apply fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while learning about responsive design, accessibility, and user experience. Throughout the development process, I focused on creating a clean, professional layout that effectively presents my work and reflects my growth as a developer.

This portfolio includes:

- A selection of my recent projects, demonstrating my understanding of front-end development principles.
- An about section, where I introduce myself and my journey into web development.
- Contact information, allowing visitors and potential collaborators to reach out.
- A responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

Since building this portfolio, I have continued to expand my knowledge in CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, and best coding practices. This project serves as a milestone in my journey as a developer, marking the foundation on which I continue to build and refine my skills.
